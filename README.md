# Clothing Store (formely LSW-Test)
Oh hello.

I did this project as a job interview/test. The assignement was to create a playable clothes shop within 84~96 hours. It went pretty much like a Game Jam does, which means: crunch time, doing stuff I'm not familiar with and having fun above all else. In the end I got pretty satisfied with the final result, especially because I managed to do everything on time and even threw in two extras - inventory management and a dialogue system.

Sadly graphics are not my forte, but I'm never content with having to scavenge free art assets made by several people with several methods and personal takes. So, yes, I did draw everything. My only imposed limitation was using the Master System Palette.
Also I have to say that my previous, personal and ancient works on RPG Maker 2000 are still present in my drawing skills.

Regarding audio, I sampled my own voice as the voice of the singular NPC - the Shopkeeper. All other sound effects were from freesound.org. The music track used was taken from zapsplat.com.

I wish I could have added more actual content to the game. Initially I planned around 4 to 8 pieces of clothing for each type - head, torso, legs and feet. However, I never had done before an animation system where your character and each individual piece of equipment/clothing animate together.
When I realized how much work it could become, for a thing that I could very well have to replace at the last second, for a project with a set deadline, I settled for only one shirt and one pair of pants only. At least it's possible to see them animate together with the character.

Anyway, it was a fun experience, and I did learn some new things from it.

If you wish to test it, I provided a build, compiled with WinRar/7Zip. Instructions:
* WASD to move around
* E to interact (must be close to something interactable)
* I to open/close inventory (there is also a button on the HUD that you can click)
* ESC to close any window
* You can exit the game by interacting with the front door or by clicking Exit Game on the HUD.

See ya!
